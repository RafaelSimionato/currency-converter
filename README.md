# currency-converter

## ⚠️ Prototype Notice

This project is an early **beta prototype** created for study, experimentation, and concept validation.  
It was **not developed for production use**, security hardening, scalability, or long-term maintenance.

Its main purpose was to explore the idea of a currency converter, test API integration, and serve as a foundation for future concepts and projects.  
Consider it a **proof of concept**, not a finished or production-ready application.
